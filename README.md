	SAS - Front End Challenge

![Application Preview](/print.png)

## ðŸ“™ Overview

As per the challenge description, its goal was to create a Quiz application. The UI was provided on fIGMA. Some of the functionalities in this application were:

- **Feedback when answering a question.**
- **Full Report at the end of the game.**

Also, some packages used were:
- **axios**
- **node-sass**
- **eslint**
- **prettier**


## ðŸ”¨ Process

First of all, after creating the application I added some best practices rules. I installed eslint and prettier and defined some rules so that other developers using the application can maintain the code integrity.

Since the prototype was given alongside the challenge, I started programming the application by its HTML and CSS, creating React components as needed. I also added the fonts used in the Figma mock.

It's important to notice that while I couldn't get some of the logic right at first, I coded as good as I could, but I do realize that's a skill I could improve given the right guidance.

As for the tests, I don't have any hands on experience with it, so I left it without testing. But I'm definitely interested in improving this skill alongside the SAS team.
